Despite the egregious dependency of having a GNU public license for kernel code, the project has adopted an Apache 2 license for the majority of our code.

We are aware of the licensing constraints while working with the Linux kernel, and are dedicated to offering free and open source software within the legal boundaries of these constraints.
